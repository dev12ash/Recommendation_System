# Recommendation_System

We aim to make a mood prediction system using facial expressions and making subsequent recommendations about the activities for the person. The activities range from some spots to visit in NITK to movie/music/novel/food recommendations etc.

We use preprocessing techniques like image augmentation to make the dataset more usable for training the network.We analyze our dataset. Then we will  implement a face detection deep learning model. We will train a six-layered neural network with our dataset. We  then evaluate the efficiency of the CNN and work to improve its efficiency,if needed. After recognizing the face, we train the CNN further to detect a person's disposition and classify it into 7 classes — happy, sad, fear, disgust, angry, neutral and surprise. Further we plan to  build a recommendation system that has activities ranging from “Going to NITK beach” to listening to a masterpiece by Frank Sinatra!
